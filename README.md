# Post-Pandemic Credit Card Introduction in India: Market Analysis and A/B Testing Approach

This project aims to launch a credit card in post-COVID India for a hypothetical bank. 
Phase 1 involved cleaning and analyzing data to identify target customer segments and in 
Phase 2 we used A/B Testing approach on two groups (test group and control group) to test 
the credibility of our new credit card.

**1. Introduction**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered consumer behavior and financial priorities worldwide, with India being no exception. 
As the country emerges from the pandemic, financial institutions face the challenge of adapting to these changes and seizing new 
opportunities. This project explores the strategic launch of a credit card by a hypothetical bank in post-COVID India, leveraging 
data-driven insights and rigorous testing to ensure market success.

**2. Project Structure**

The project is divided into two phases. Phase 1 focuses on understanding the target market through meticulous data cleaning, 
pre-processing, and visualization. By analyzing demographic and financial trends, we aim to identify the most promising customer 
segments for the new credit card. This phase is crucial for tailoring the product to meet the specific needs and preferences of 
potential users.

Phase 2 involves performing A/B testing to validate our market assumptions and refine the product features and marketing strategies. 
By comparing the responses of two distinct groups, we seek to determine the effectiveness of different approaches and make data-informed
decisions. The results of these tests provide critical insights into consumer behavior and preferences, enabling us to optimize the 
credit card offering.

**3. Usage**

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the Jupyter Notebook for this project.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saar4nsh/Post-Pandemic_Credit-Card_Introduction_in_India-Market_Analysis_and_A-B_Testing_Approach.git
cd Post-Pandemic_Credit-Card_Introduction_in_India-Market_Analysis_and_A-B_Testing_Approach
```

**Step 2: Installations**

You will need to install all these packages in one go using the following pip command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook**

Launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line:

jupyter notebook

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

**Step 4: Open and Run the Notebook**

In the Jupyter Notebook interface:

1. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. Open the main notebook file (e.g., phase_1.ipynb).
3. Run the notebook cells in order. You can do this by clicking on each cell and pressing Shift + Enter or by using the "Run" button 
in the toolbar.

Example Notebook Cell Execution

1. Data Loading: The first few cells typically involve loading the necessary libraries and datasets.
2. Data Preprocessing: Follow the cells that preprocess the data.
3. Analysis and Visualization: Execute the cells that perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
4. Modeling: Run the cells that build, train, and evaluate machine learning models.
5. Results: Finally, review the cells that present the results and conclusions.

**4. Data**
The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle Telco Customer Churn dataset. It includes information about customer demographics, 
account information, and services used.

**5. Results**
At the end of the project we were able to find the right target market for out new credit card based on the analysis and data visualisations of datasets we had and 
successfully conducted A/B Testing on control and target groups , and we rejected our null hypothesis that the new credit card does not
increase average transaction amount with a confidence level of 95%.
